# Bottom-of-Bikini
The inspired theme for this game comes from the show SpongeBob SquarePants where you have to move the coral with the keys left and right arrow in order to avoid Mr.Krabby from falling. The goal of the game is to make Mr.Krabby hit all of the optopuses so you can move onto the next level.
