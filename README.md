# Bottom-of-Bikini
The inspired theme for this game comes from the show SpongeBob SquarePants where you have to move the coral with the keys left and right arrow in order to avoid Mr.Krabby from falling. The goal of the game is to make Mr.Krabby hit all of the optopuses so you can move onto the next level. You have to hit the big optopus three times while the small ones have to be hit twice. You can also gain a special power up that will show a hamburger object that behaves the same as Mr. Krabby. As you keep hitting Mr. Krabby with the coral, it will jump and move each time much faster.
